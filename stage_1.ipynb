    "The script broke on line 701 of the list with player profile links. The underlying reason was that Nikita Glotov (profile page https://en.khl.ru/players/16467/) has participated in an off-season tournament between the KHL teams (Nadezhda Cup) but never in the regular season nor playoff matches. As a result, he has no match-level statistics yet is in the KHL database due to having a season-level statistics, however weird that might sound.\n",

    "The last table on the page is supposed to be the match-level statistics yet ends up being the season-level statistics. It messes up the entire dataset, with the season-level statistics becoming the the player information and the player information getting replaced by a random table showing the result of one of the latest matches that is present on all pages of the KHL website.\n",

    "We definitely need to alter a script so that it would check whether the dataframe for the player's match statistics is indeed containing it. The easiest way to do that would be to check the header. If the header matches the standard one, then the script goes ahead with cleaning the data and adding it to the rest. However, we need to decide what to do with such players after identifying them.\n",
