# KHL Data Analysis
##Overview
Sports analytics is an actively growing field. Being a hockey fan myself, I am curious to see whether I manage to extract any interesting insights from the data for the KHL (Kontinental Hockey League).

The teams in KHL are much less comparable with each other than in NHL, with many teams being severely under the salary cap. In fact, for several KHL teams their budgets are less than half of the salary cap. Naturally, this creates a discrepancy in the teams' performance that affects how well the players perform on the ice.

Is a player's statistic for a season good because of his skills and talent, or because he played games in a wealthy team with many talented players? How could we adjusted the season statistics to account for it? That question is at the core of this project with an ultimate goal of dissecting the role of a team in the individual players' achievements.

In addition, contracts in KHL tend to be relatively short-term for both the players and the staff. As such, they have less time to gain experience of playing together and might depend even more on how well the coaches can adapt to the constantly changing teams. Analysing the roles of coaches in their team's season performance is one of the other goals of this project.

##Team-level analysis
While my aim is to gather more data to include both the coaches and the individual players into the models, some high-level exploratory analysis is necessary first. As such, I am going to be using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle on KHL game outcomes for 2008-2019. The link for it is provided at the end of this file.
